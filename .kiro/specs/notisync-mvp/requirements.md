# Requirements Document

## Introduction

NotiSync is a smart notification hub that addresses notification overload across multiple apps and devices. The MVP focuses on core functionality including cross-device notification mirroring, smart categorization, custom rules, basic daily digest, and notification history storage. This system will provide users with clarity, control, and productivity by ensuring that the right notifications are seen at the right time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Device Notification Mirroring

**User Story:** As a user, I want my mobile notifications to appear on my web/desktop client, so that I can stay informed without constantly checking my phone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is received on the mobile device THEN the system SHALL mirror the notification to all connected web/desktop clients within 2 seconds
2. WHEN a user dismisses a notification on any device THEN the system SHALL remove the notification from all other connected devices
3. WHEN a user marks a notification as read on any device THEN the system SHALL update the read status across all devices
4. IF the web/desktop client is offline THEN the system SHALL queue notifications and sync them when the connection is restored
5. WHEN a notification contains sensitive content THEN the system SHALL respect the original app's privacy settings for lock screen display

### Requirement 2: Smart Notification Categorization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my notifications automatically categorized into Work, Personal, and Junk, so that I can focus on what's important.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is received THEN the system SHALL automatically classify it into one of three categories: Work, Personal, or Junk
2. WHEN a notification is from a known work app (Slack, Teams, Outlook) THEN the system SHALL categorize it as Work
3. WHEN a notification is from a social or messaging app THEN the system SHALL categorize it as Personal
4. WHEN a notification contains promotional keywords or is from known spam sources THEN the system SHALL categorize it as Junk
5. WHEN a user manually recategorizes a notification THEN the system SHALL learn from this feedback for future similar notifications
6. WHEN displaying notifications THEN the system SHALL group them by category with clear visual distinction

### Requirement 3: Custom Notification Rules

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create custom rules for handling specific types of notifications, so that I can ensure important alerts are never missed and unwanted ones are filtered out.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a rule to "always show OTP notifications" THEN the system SHALL prioritize and highlight all OTP-containing notifications regardless of other filters
2. WHEN a user creates a rule to "mute promotional notifications" THEN the system SHALL automatically silence notifications containing promotional keywords
3. WHEN a user sets up app-specific rules THEN the system SHALL apply these rules to all notifications from the specified app
4. WHEN multiple rules conflict THEN the system SHALL apply the most specific rule first, then fall back to general rules
5. WHEN a user creates a time-based rule (e.g., "mute work notifications after 6 PM") THEN the system SHALL respect the specified time constraints
6. WHEN a rule is created or modified THEN the system SHALL apply it to future notifications immediately

### Requirement 4: Basic Daily Digest

**User Story:** As a user, I want a daily summary of my notifications, so that I can review what I might have missed without AI complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a day ends THEN the system SHALL generate a digest containing notification counts by category
2. WHEN generating the digest THEN the system SHALL include the top 5 most important notifications based on user-defined rules
3. WHEN a user requests their daily digest THEN the system SHALL display it within the app with clear categorization
4. WHEN the digest is generated THEN the system SHALL include statistics like total notifications received, dismissed, and acted upon
5. IF no significant notifications occurred THEN the system SHALL display a simple "quiet day" message instead of an empty digest

### Requirement 5: Notification History Storage

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access my notification history for the past 7 days, so that I can find notifications I might have accidentally dismissed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is received THEN the system SHALL store it in the history with timestamp, content, source app, and category
2. WHEN a user searches notification history THEN the system SHALL return results filtered by date, app, category, or content keywords
3. WHEN 7 days have passed since a notification was received THEN the system SHALL automatically delete it from storage
4. WHEN a user views notification history THEN the system SHALL display notifications in reverse chronological order with clear visual indicators for read/unread status
5. WHEN a user clicks on a historical notification THEN the system SHALL show the full notification details and allow actions if still relevant

### Requirement 6: User Authentication and Device Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to securely connect multiple devices to my notification sync account, so that my data remains private and accessible only to my authorized devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL require secure authentication (email/password with verification)
2. WHEN a user adds a new device THEN the system SHALL require authentication and display the device in a management interface
3. WHEN a user wants to remove a device THEN the system SHALL immediately revoke access and stop syncing to that device
4. WHEN a user logs out from any device THEN the system SHALL clear all cached notification data from that device
5. IF suspicious login activity is detected THEN the system SHALL notify the user and require additional verification

### Requirement 7: Real-time Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my notification actions (read, dismiss, interact) to sync instantly across devices, so that I have a consistent experience everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs any action on a notification THEN the system SHALL sync this action to all connected devices within 1 second
2. WHEN the network connection is unstable THEN the system SHALL queue sync operations and retry automatically
3. WHEN a device comes back online after being offline THEN the system SHALL sync all missed notification states within 5 seconds
4. WHEN multiple devices perform conflicting actions simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use timestamp-based conflict resolution
5. WHEN sync fails after multiple retries THEN the system SHALL notify the user and provide manual sync options
